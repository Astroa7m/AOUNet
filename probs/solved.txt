The problem of resolving imports is by creating a top-level pyproject.toml file as the following:
```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "AOUNet"
version = "0.0.1"

[tool.setuptools]
packages = ["data", "data_prep", "graph", "common"]
```

-Under within packages list we add all the packages/modules/dir that are used as imports within other files
-Give a proper name to the project
- then run `pip install -e .`
